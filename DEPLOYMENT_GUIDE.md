## üñ•Ô∏è Running Locally

### 1. Start the Backend
```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd C:\Users\KIIT\projects\pm-internship-recommender

# Start Flask server
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe" backend\app.py
```

The API will be available at: `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Open the Frontend
```powershell
# Open in default browser
Start-Process "frontend/index.html"
```

Or navigate to: `file:///C:/Users/KIIT/projects/pm-internship-recommender/frontend/index.html`

## üì± Testing Mobile Experience

### On Desktop (Mobile Simulation)
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Click mobile device icon 
3. Select iPhone/Android viewport
4. Test touch interactions and responsiveness

### On Real Mobile Device
1. Start local server as above
2. Find your computer's IP address: `ipconfig`
3. On mobile, navigate to: `http://[YOUR_IP]:5000/frontend/`
4. Test PWA install by clicking "Add to Home Screen"

## üåç Deploying to Production

### **Unified Render Deployment (Current Setup)**

Your app is configured for **single-URL deployment** on Render:

1. **Commit your changes:**
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Complete integration with mobile PWA features"
git push origin main
```

2. **Automatic deployment:**
Your existing Render service will automatically deploy to:
**üîó https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com**

3. **Complete experience from one URL:**
   - Frontend: `https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com/`
   - API: `https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com/api/*`
   - All assets served from same domain

### Alternative: Vercel Deployment

1. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect the `vercel.json` configuration
   - Deploy will be live at: `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### Option 2: Other Platforms

**Netlify:** Upload `frontend/` folder as static site, deploy backend separately
**Heroku:** Use `Procfile` already included in project
**Railway:** Connect GitHub repo for automatic deployment

## üîß Configuration

### API URL Management
The frontend automatically detects environment:
- **Local development:** Uses `http://localhost:5000/api`
- **Production:** Uses relative URLs `/api` (same domain as frontend)
- **Unified deployment:** Both frontend and API served from `https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com`

### Environment Variables (Production)
```
FLASK_ENV=production
PORT=5000 (or platform-assigned)
```

## üìä API Endpoints

Your backend provides these endpoints:

### Health Check
```
GET /
Response: {"message": "PM Internship Recommender API", "status": "active"}
```

### Get Recommendations
```
POST /api/recommend
Body: {
  "education": "undergraduate",
  "skills": ["computer", "communication"],  
  "interests": ["technology"],
  "location": "bangalore"
}
```

### All Internships
```
GET /api/internships
```

### Search Internships  
```
GET /api/internships/search?sector=technology&location=remote
```
