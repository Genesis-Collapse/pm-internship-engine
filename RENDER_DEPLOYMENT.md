# 🚀 Unified Render Deployment Guide

## ✨ Single URL Deployment

Your PM Internship Recommender is now configured for **unified deployment** where both frontend and backend are served from the same URL: `https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com`

## 🏗️ How It Works

### **Smart Routing System**
- **Frontend**: `https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com/` → Serves the main application
- **API**: `https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com/api/*` → All API endpoints  
- **Assets**: `https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com/styles.css` → CSS, JS, images

### **Flask Backend Handles Everything**
```python
# Main route serves frontend HTML for browsers
@app.route('/')
def home():
    if 'text/html' in request.headers.get('Accept', ''):
        return send_file('frontend/index.html')  # Serve frontend app
    return jsonify({"status": "API active"})     # API status for tools

# Static files (CSS, JS, images)
@app.route('/<path:filename>')
def serve_static_files(filename):
    return send_from_directory('frontend/', filename)
```

## 🚀 Deploy to Render

### **Step 1: Commit Your Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Unified deployment: Frontend + Backend integration"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Render Auto-Deploy**
Your existing Render service at `https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com` will automatically:
1. **Detect changes** in your GitHub repository
2. **Install dependencies** from `requirements.txt` 
3. **Start Flask server** which now serves both frontend and API
4. **Live at single URL** - No separate deployments needed!

### **Step 3: Verify Deployment**
After deployment, test these URLs:

**Frontend (Main App):**
```
https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com/
```

**API Endpoints:**
```
https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com/api/recommend
https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com/api/internships  
https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com/api/sectors
```

**Static Assets:**
```
https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com/styles.css
https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com/script.js
https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com/manifest.json
```

## 📱 Benefits of Unified Deployment

### **1. Single URL** 
- ✅ Users only need one link: `https://pm-internship-engine.onrender.com`
- ✅ No CORS issues between frontend and backend
- ✅ Simpler to share and remember

### **2. Cost Effective**
- ✅ One Render service instead of two
- ✅ No additional hosting costs
- ✅ Easier resource management

### **3. Better Performance**
- ✅ No cross-domain API calls
- ✅ Faster loading (same server)
- ✅ Better caching strategies

### **4. Simpler Maintenance**
- ✅ One deployment pipeline
- ✅ Single repository management
- ✅ Unified logging and monitoring

## 🔧 Local Development

**Start integrated server:**
```bash
python backend/app.py
```

**Access locally:**
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5000/`
- API: `http://localhost:5000/api/recommend`

## 📊 URL Structure

| URL | Purpose | Response |
|-----|---------|----------|
| `/` | Main App | Frontend HTML |
| `/styles.css` | Styling | CSS File |
| `/script.js` | Frontend Logic | JavaScript |
| `/manifest.json` | PWA Config | JSON |
| `/sw.js` | Service Worker | JavaScript |
| `/api/recommend` | Get Recommendations | JSON API |
| `/api/internships` | All Internships | JSON API |
| `/api/sectors` | Available Sectors | JSON API |

## 🎯 Target Audience Integration

### **For Rural Users**
- **Simple URL**: Easy to type and share
- **Single destination**: No confusion about different URLs
- **Works offline**: PWA features intact

### **For Administrators**
- **API access**: Still available at `/api/*` endpoints
- **Monitoring**: Single service to monitor
- **Analytics**: Unified traffic analytics

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If Frontend Doesn't Load**
Check file paths in Flask app - should be `frontend/index.html`

### **If API Doesn't Work** 
Verify routes start with `/api/` and don't conflict with static files

### **If PWA Features Break**
Ensure `manifest.json` and `sw.js` are accessible via static file serving

## 🌟 Production Ready Features

Your unified deployment includes:
- ✅ **Progressive Web App** capabilities
- ✅ **Offline functionality** via service worker
- ✅ **Mobile optimization** and responsive design
- ✅ **Smart API routing** with proper error handling
- ✅ **Static file serving** for all assets
- ✅ **Development/production** environment detection

## 🎉 Success!
